The Sales Data Analysis project aimed to analyze the sales data of a fictional e-commerce company. By leveraging Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, along with MySQL for data storage and retrieval, we explored various aspects of customer behaviour, product performance, and sales trends. This report presents our findings, insights, and recommendations derived from the analysis.
